Laravel Headless CMS follows the JSON:API standard for building APIs in JSON. JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests. It`s specifically designed to increase efficiency by keeping the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers to a minimum.

## Introduction

JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests. It is designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising readability, flexibility, or discoverability.

## Prerequisites

The Laravel JSON:API backend project requires a proper multi-threaded web server such as Apache/Nginx environment with PHP, Composer and MySQL.

**Do not use `php artisan serve` as it will result in stalled requests due to the single-threaded nature of the built-in PHP web server.** 

We strongly recommend using [Laradock](https://laradock.io/) for Linux and Mac or [Laragon](https://laragon.org/download/) for Windows if possible.

Other options for your local environment:
- Windows: [How to install WAMP on Windows](https://updivision.com/blog/post/beginner-s-guide-to-setting-up-your-local-development-environment-on-windows)
- Linux & Mac: [How to install LAMP on Linux & Mac](https://updivision.com/blog/post/guide-what-is-lamp-and-how-to-install-it-on-ubuntu-and-macos)

You will also need to install Composer 2: [https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

## Laravel JSON:API Project Installation

1. Navigate in your Laravel API project folder: `cd your-laravel-json-api-project`
2. Install project dependencies: `composer install`
3. Create a new .env file: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Add your own database credentials in the .env file in DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD
5. Create users table: `php artisan migrate --seed`
6. Generate application key: `php artisan key:generate`
7. Install Laravel Passport: `php artisan passport:install`
8. Add your own mailtrap.io credentials in MAIL_USERNAME and MAIL_PASSWORD in the .env file

## Usage

You can register as a user or log in using one of the default users: 

- admin type - **admin@jsonapi.com** with the password **secret**
- creator type - **creator@jsonapi.com** with the password **secret**
- member type - **member@jsonapi.com** with the password **secret**

A **member type** user can log in, update his profile and view a list of added items.  
A **creator type** user can log in, update his profile and perform actions on categories, tags and items.
A **admin type** user can log in, update his profile and perform actions on categories, tags, items, roles and users.
